        <p> Traditional NBA Superstars have either been really tall or really athletic. Stephen Curry not so much. Curry is widely
            known for being the greatest shooter of all time, but that's literally all people talk about. Just him being a great shooter.
            But just how good is he really, if we ignore his superior shooting? Are there any other superior attributes to his game?
            Was his unique offensive approach so game-changing, that it made him into perhaps the greatest offensive player in NBA
            history?

            Every offensive great knew how to pressure the rim and get to their sweet spots. Kareem had his sky-hooks,
            Jordan had midrange pull-up jumpers, Shaq had the paint and LeBron charged towards the basket aggressively
            thanks to his large frame. Curry wasn't built for either of those playstyles, so he came up with a brilliant idea.
            He turned the 3-point line into his own personal layup.
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            From 2016-19, Curry made nearly 50% of his wide-open threes, which
            is equivalent to shooting over 70% from 2-point range, Efficiency that only incredible rim finishers can generate.
            But instead of being limited to staying in the paint, or inside the perimeter, he could manufacture his own long-range
            layup from all over the court. And when defenders were close to him, he still made over 43% of his three-point shots, which
            is equivalent to a 65% two-point shot.
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            There have been other NBA Legends that have shot at incredible percentages as well,
            but none of them matched the range from which Curry is shooting, the difficulty of his shots and the volume of the shots
            attempted. All of it starts with his release speed, which is the quickest of all time. It takes 0.4 seconds
            for Curry to get his shot off from anywhere on the court. Instead of using vertical jump height to get his shot off like
            Jordan, he used speed so defenders couldn't close the distance between them in time.
        </p>

            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite Curry's humbleness and selflessness, people always find a way to hate on him for whatever reason.
            "He's overrated", "He doesn't show up in big games" and so on. So i decided to take all the players which are known
            to be universally the greatest NBA players of all time and rank each of their best seasons by Efficiency and Scoring Rate
            to see who's the greatest offensive player of all time.
