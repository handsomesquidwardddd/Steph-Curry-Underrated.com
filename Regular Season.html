        <p>
            I have spent countless hours to create a table and rank the greatest Seasons by the greatest Players
            to ever play NBA Basketball by relative True Shooting Percentage. The other 122 Seasons are too much to look at.
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Out of the 132 greatest Regular Seasons
            of all time, Curry takes rank Number:
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            1, 2, 6, 16, 19, 25, 33, 47, 48 and 74.
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you were to average out everyone's rank on the list, you'd end up with Curry at the Number 2 spot, only behind
            Kevin Durant. Kevin Durant's stats are heavily inflated though, because his Efficiency took an enormous spike in the
            seasons that he played with Stephen Curry.
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Since it takes unique defensive attention and set-ups to guard Curry, there have
            been numerous instances in the 2017, 2018 and 2019 seasons, where people would rather double or even triple team Stephen Curry
            at the three-point line, while Kevin Durant is running at them with the ball in his hands. That's right. Teams would rather
            have Kevin Durant lay the ball in than let Steph Curry shoot the ball from 20+ meters.
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            On the next page titled "Steph's monstrous 2020-21 Season", you can see Steph's insane 2020-21 season, where he played with a team full
            of G-League or very unexperienced Players.
